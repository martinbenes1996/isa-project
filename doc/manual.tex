    The task of the project was to gather informations about DHCP protocol and
    afterwards write a program in C, that performs a DHCP starvation attack.
    
    
    
    \section*{DHCP}
    
    
    \subsection*{Motivation}
    Every private network manages its own IP address space with reserved addresses, that
    can be given to the internal devices. An assignment of the addresses may be
    done either manually or automatically, using DHCP agent.
    
    Manual configuration forces the network administrator to manually setup the
    local address for every device, newly connected to the network.
    
    The more pleasant way, especially for administrator, is using {\it plug-and-play}
    DHCP protocol, where the address assignment is done by DHCP server.
    \cite{computernetworking} \cite{pocitacovesite}
    
    
    
    \subsection*{DHCP protocol}

        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    
    When a device shows up in the network, it has not any local address, yet
    it may communicate via broadcast.
    
    \subparagraph{DHCP Discovery}
    The device has to inform DHCP server about itself. The DHCP server does not have
    any strict local address, so the device sends DHCP Discovery packet to the
    broadcast address ff.ff.ff.ff, which is received by every device in the
    network, including the DHCP server.
    
    \subparagraph{DHCP Offer}
    The server then reserves an address for the device, and sends DHCP Offer
    response, unicast or multicast (set in received DHCP Discovery). If the
    unicast is used, the MAC address from the DHCP Discovery is used as target
    address (on L2).
    
    \subparagraph{DHCP Request}
    The DHCP client (the device) then sends DHCP Request to the server (again
    it must be to the broadcast address, the local address is not assigned yet).
    The client may receive several DHCP Offer packets (there might be more DHCP
    servers in the network), but when the servers receives the DHCP Request from
    the client, answering another server, they will withdraw the offer and return
    the reserved address back to the address pool.
    
    \subparagraph{DHCP Acknowledgement}
    After receiving the DHCP Request, the server sends DHCP Acknowledgement,
    including address lease duration. \cite{mistrovstvivsitich} \cite{DHCPwikipedia}
    \cite{IPKDHCP}
    
    
    
    \subsection*{DHCP Attack variants}
    
    \paragraph{DHCP Discovery flood}
    The clients sends repeatedly a large number of DHCP Discovery attacks with 
    randomly generated MAC address (in {\it chaddr}). As a result, the DHCP server will
    offer the whole pool using {\it DORA}\footnote{DHCP Discover - DHCP Offer - DHCP
    Request - DHCP Acknowledgement packet sequence.} process, so the new legitimate
    clients will not obtain an IP addresses from DHCP address.
    
    In WPA 2 (IEEE 802.11), a client connection includes an association with AP
    (Access Point) and session key generation, where the client's MAC address is used.
    The AP has a maximal number of addresses it can associate, which prevents
    the pool from exhaustion.
    
    This may be solved with using different MAC address in ethernet header and
    DHCP header. The ethernet header (read by AP) uses client's real MAC, so
    it is forwarded, because it is already associated. The DHCP header than includes
    the randomly generated MAC address.
    
    \paragraph{Induced DHCP starvation}
    In this type of attack, there are three parties, a victim, a client, who wants to
    acquire an IP from a server, the server, that assigns IP addresses and an
    attacker, that listens to the communication using {\it eavesdropping}. 
    
    The client and the server do the classic DORA process, without any interrogation
    of the attacker listening. After that, the client sends ARP\_REQ broadcast packet
    checking the assigned IP address. The source IP address is still set to 0.0.0.0,
    because the client still does not have the configured IP yet.
    
    The attacker then reacts with ARP\_REPLY, which is received by the client.
    The destination IP address of the packet is 0.0.0.0.
    
    The malicious client sends DHCP Decline to the server to avoid the IP conflict,
    because it is convinced, that the IP address received from the DHCP server
    has already been assigned (to the attacker).
    
    The server marks the IP address as unvailable for a lease period. The victim starts
    the whole procedure repeateadly until the pool is fully unavailable.
    \cite{IBSattack}
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Security mechanisms}
    
    \paragraph{Port security}
    The simpliest way, how to prevent such attacks is limitation of MAC addresses
    per port in a network switch. If the limit is reached, the incident is reported
    from a agent (switch) to the manager as SNMP trap.
    
    This check is applicable to the DHCP Discovery flood attack, where the MAC address
    in the L2 is randomly generated, but is not, if the different MAC addresses are used.
    
    \paragraph{DHCP snooping}
    This type of mechanism checks the matching MAC address in ethernet header
    and in {\it chaddr} in DHCP header, it can detect the attack, where the MAC
    addresses differ.
    
    \paragraph{Dynamic ARP inspection}
    DAI uses DHCP snooping check and creates a database of records {\it MAC address
    - IP address - VLAN interface}. It is filled with scanned DHCP communication
    of the client with a DHCP server.
    
    It is able to detect, if the senders MAC address and IP address, acquired from
    the DHCP server in the previous DORA communication, are the same as in
    incoming packet. If not so, the fake ICMP communication is recognized as not
    valid and the actions against it are taken. \cite{DHCPstarvation}
    
    
    \section*{Implementation}
    
    \subsection*{Network}
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \begin{center}
    %        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{network.png}
            \caption{ Test network. \label{fig:network} \cite{laptop}}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    The used test network was my personal home network. It consists of wireless
    devices, connected to the wireless router, which contains access point and DHCP agent.
    There is no protection like port security or DHCP snooping done.
    
    The router is then connected to the internet, and wireless devices, like my laptop
    or mobile are able to connect the internet indirectly through the AP.
    
    \subsection*{Program}
    
    The program was done in C, some tools were taken from C++. It implements the attack,
    where a DHCP Discovery packets are generated with random MAC in the DHCP header,
    but with real MAC is used in the link layer.
    
    Firstly, I wanted to do the program using raw socket. This would be needed, if 
    I would want to generate packets with random MAC address in Ethernet header as well.
    Then it came to me, that they do not have to be needed afterall. I rewrote the
    program and ended up with one third of a length of the code, but a fully functional.

        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    
    
    \subsection*{Testing}
    For the testing, I used Wireshark to watch the network traffic. I attach a
    screenshot of testing procedure.
    
    When the program starts, every sent DHCP Discovery packet is followed by DHCP Offer
    packet. After sending a specific count of packets, there is no coming DHCP
    Offer whatsoever.
    
    The addresses starts with 10.0.2.16. Then they are offered one-by-one sequentially,
    ending with 10.0.2.30. More coming offers with a local IP address are not
    received.
